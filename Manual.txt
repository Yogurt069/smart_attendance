Hi! This file is here to assist you in understanding the process;

1. Go to directory start-from-here and then run 'create-table.py' program, this will create a new mysql db.

2. Come back to our original directory fill and then open 'students.txt'. Here you will see some registration
   number with Names.
   Now run 'add_data.py', this program will add the registration number and Name to the database;

3. If you want to register your face or update your face. Run 'dubli.py' this program will use your camera (of
   laptop or any other device connected with access of camera) and will ask the user for his registration number
   and name. So do the input, your face model will get saved in 'face_model.yml' file.

   NOTE // This face registration will only be done once or when you want to update your face model.

4. Now Finally run 'main.py', this program will turn use the camera (of laptop or any) and will write the least 
   confident face-model's registration number and ask the user whether it's him or not?
   if the user replies yes it will mark present in the attendance or else will return error and will ask the user to 
   try again, or check or update the face model.

5. If you want to check the attendance record you can run 'show_records.py' .

NOTE // IN 'main.py' AND 'dubli.py' SET cam = cv2.VideoCapture(1) TO cam = cv2.VideoCapture(0) IF YOU'RE USING 
        LAPTOP'S CAMERA;
